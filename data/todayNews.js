      "WASHINGTON — NASA has picked four Earth science mission proposals for further study while separately selecting a smaller Earth science technology demonstration mission for development. NASA said May 7 it selected four proposals for its first Earth System Explorer missions for initial Phase A studies, lasting one year. Each of the proposed missions will receive $5 million from the agency to carry out the studies to refine their mission designs. NASA will then select two of the proposals for development. One of the selected missions would launch by 2030 and the other by 2032. Each mission will have a cost cap of $310 million, excluding launch. The four mission proposals NASA selected for study are: Stratosphere Troposphere Response using Infrared Vertically-Resolved Light Explorer (STRIVE), which will measure temperature, composition and aerosols from the upper troposphere to the mesosphere; Ocean Dynamics and Surface Exchange with the Atmosphere (ODYSEA), a mission to simultaneously measure ocean currents and winds to better understand interactions between the ocean and atmosphere; Earth Dynamics Geodetic Explorer (EDGE), which will provide three-dimensional structures of terrestrial ecosystems, including measuring glaciers, ice sheets and sea ice; and The Carbon Investigation (Carbon-I), a mission to provide measurements of various greenhouse gases, including natural and human-made sources, to better understand the carbon cycle. The missions will be the first for the Earth System Explorer program, which NASA established in response to the 2018 Earth science decal survey. That report recommended NASA develop a line of competed missions that are less expensive that directed Earth science missions but larger than its Earth Venture line of smallsat missions and instruments. NASA had planned to start the program as early as 2020 but delayed it because of budget constraints. “The proposals represent another example of NASA’s holistic approach to studying our home planet,” Nicky Fox, NASA’s associate administrator for science, said in a statement. “As we continue to confront our changing climate, and its impacts on humans and our environment, the need for data and scientific research could not be greater.” NASA officials said in a town hall meeting in March that they would spread out the cadence of announcements of opportunity (AOs) for Earth System Explorer and Earth Venture projects to avoid overloading institutions interested in those programs with simultaneous calls for proposals. A chart shown in that meeting indicated that the next Earth System Explorer AO would be released in 2029 for a mission launching in 2037. In addition to Earth System Explorer and Earth Venture programs, NASA plans to compete a mission for part of its restructured Earth System Observatory. That restructuring involves splitting large missions into several smaller, less expensive ones whose launches will be spread out. The competed mission, called Atmosphere Observing System – Cloud (AOS-Cloud), would have a cost cap excluding launch of $400 million and launch readiness date of 2031, according to a community announcement released by NASA in April announcing its plans for the upcoming competition. NASA is separately moving forward on a smaller Earth science technology demonstration mission. The agency has selected the Gravitational Reference Advanced Technology Test In Space (GRATTIS) mission, led by the University of Florida, for development and launch. The $12 million mission will test a new sensor proposed for use on future missions to measure the Earth’s gravitational field. “Our technology will provide vital insights into the movement of water and ice across the planet,” John Conklin, principal investigator of GRATTIS at the University of Florida, in a statement. “This data is essential for monitoring droughts, assessing groundwater reserves, and understanding the impact of melting ice sheets on sea levels.” GRATTIS will use an Aries spacecraft bus provided by Apex Space and will launch on a SpaceX Transporter rideshare mission no earlier than October 2026.",

      "HELSINKI — India is developing plans for its Chandrayaan-4 moon sample return mission that will include the country’s emerging private sector. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is working on plans for the moon sample return as part of its followup to last year’s successful Chandrayaan-3 lunar landing. The multi-launch, multi-spacecraft mission would aim to land at Shiv Shakti Point, the landing site of Chandrayaan-3. The aim is to collect an unspecified mass of lunar samples and deliver them to Earth. Nilesh Desai, Director of the Space Applications Centre (SAC), revealed the details in a presentation marking National Technology Day at SAC in Ahmedabad. “We are working on that and hopefully in the next four or five years or so. This also opens up many new technologies. The private sector also is going to be involved in a big way,” Desai said. India has made a series of efforts to foster a private space sector, including a new national space policy introduced in 2023. Leveraging this for a flagship mission would be another such move. The country is also chasing a surge in civil and private launches in the near future. The Chandrayaan-4 mission will be complex. Two separate launch vehicles to launch four spacecraft: A PSLV and a LVM-3. The former will send a transfer module (TM) and reentry module (RM) into a sub-geostationary transfer orbit, gradually raising to lunar distance. The latter will launch a lander module (LM) and ascender module (AM). A propulsion module will assist the latter pair. The RM and TM will park in lunar orbit while the LM and AM descend to the moon. Operations on the lunar surface will take place within a single lunar day. A robotic arm will transfer collected samples to the AM. This will then launch into lunar orbit to rendezvous with the TM. A robotic arm aboard the TM will transfer samples to the RM before heading to Earth. The RM will then separate from the TM close to Earth for reentry and landing. It is unclear if funding for the mission has been secured, but ISRO plans state it would launch no earlier than 2028. As the mission profile includes lunar orbit rendezvous and docking techniques, rather than a direct return of samples to Earth, it would also have applicability for future crewed lunar missions. India Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October 2023 announced a 2040 target for putting astronauts on the moon. ISRO Chairman S. Somanath last year gave a presentation with Chandrayaan-4 as part of a roadmap envisioning Indian astronauts on the moon and a base around 2047. Indian Moon base in the 2040s? ISRO chairman S. Somanath gave a lecture at ISG-ISRS 2023, outlining an integrated lunar exploration roadmap with the long term plan of a lunar base around 2047. Reiterates plan announced last month for a crewed lunar landing by 2040. Ambitious. pic.twitter.com/GS4HU8BOiz — Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) November 30, 2023 India is also working on the Lunar Polar Exploration (LuPEx) mission with Japan. That is to consist of an ISRO lander and a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) rover to explore permanently shadowed craters. The mission will launch on a Japanese H3 rocket. ISRO’s own part in the mission is again unclear in terms of budget and approval. India’s suggested launch dates appear to be later than those in Japanese statements. The mission will aim to land at exactly 90 degrees at the lunar south pole, Desai said. Desai also touched on plans for a Mars Lander Mission (MLM), a followup to the 2013 Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM). “Going there for nine months and then landing, that is the biggest challenge,” Desai noted. He also listed critical technologies for the mission as a supersonic parachute, aerodynamic design for landing, and a sky-crane for lander deployment. An LVM-3 would launch MLM, while a relay satellite would be launched on a PSLV. A range of proposed science payloads for a mission rover include a ground-penetrating radar, mineral-mapping spectrometers, a raman spectrometer for seeking biosignatures, a range of cameras and an in-situ resource utilization instrument. India’s MOM mission made it the first Asian nation to put a spacecraft in Mars orbit. Only the United States and China have successfully landed and operated rovers on Mars.",

      "WASHINGTON — European space company OHB expects to wrap up a deal with investment company KKR to go private within the next several weeks as it prepares for two key launches this summer. Marco Fuchs, chief executive of OHB, said in a May 8 earnings call that all that was left to complete a deal with KKR announced in August to take the company private was final regulatory approvals in two countries, Belgium and Germany. He said he expected those countries to sign off on the deal soon. “We don’t see this as a concern,” he said of the pending approvals. “We feel that this will be completed in the next weeks and we feel that everything should be finalized before our annual meeting at the end of June.” Under the deal, KKR offered to buy shares on the public market not owned by the Fuchs family, which maintains a controlling stake in the company, for 44 euros ($47.50) per share. As of November, KKR and the Fuchs family owned 94% of all OHB shares. Fuchs said in November that the reason for the deal was to take the company private, arguing that smaller companies like OHB are “structurally undervalued” on public markets. He said in the earnings call that he expected OHB to delist from public exchanges once the company received the remaining regulatory approvals. The conclusion of that deal comes as OHB is involved with the first launches of two new rockets in the next several months. Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA), a launch vehicle company spun out of OHB in 2018, is preparing for the first launch of its RFA ONE rocket from SaxaVord Spaceport in the Shetland Islands. Fuchs said that RFA is gearing up for hotfire tests of the rocket’s first stage at the spaceport soon. “We are still working under the assumption that we have a launch late in the summer,” he said, with a current no-earlier-than launch date of Aug. 1. OHB is also a supplier for the Ariane 6, whose first launch is slated for this summer as well. “We are very confident that Ariane 6 will launch within the known launch period from mid-June through the end of July,” he said. “I think preparations are going very well.” Another Ariane 6 contractor, Avio, offered a similar assessment in its earnings call May 9, projecting a launch some time in July. Neither the prime contractor, ArianeGroup, not the European Space Agency have announced a more specific launch date for the long-delayed inaugural flight of the rocket. The company also played down reports in German media that the German government was unhappy with the contract being negotiated by the European Commission with an industrial consortium that includes OHB for the Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnectivity and Security by Satellite (IRIS²) constellation. According to one report, a German minister wrote to EU officials criticizing the management of IRIS² and it scosts, which he claimed was now approaching 12 billion euros, nearly double earlier estimates. Commission officials had expected early this year to finalize a contract with the consortium by the end of March. However, that contract has not been signed and, in April, Theirry Breton, EU commissioner for the internal market, said only that the evaluation of the contract was ongoing. He did not estimate when that work would be completed. “I don’t think politics is the major delay for this one. It’s a very complex project,” said Markus Moeller, OHB’s chief strategy and business development officer, on the call. “There’s always politics in the background — it’s a federal program for Europe — but on the other hand, the delays that we see are delays that could be expected in a program of that scale.” OHB reported revenues of 206.7 million euros in the first quarter, 2% more than the same quarter a year ago. Net profit, though, was down 24% at 7.08 million euros. The company maintained its projection of 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion euros of revenue for the full year. The revenue OHB reported was a first-quarter record for the company, but Fuchs sounded underwhelmed. “It didn’t feel very exciting, this number,” he said on the call.",

      "Paul Hill, a former NASA space shuttle flight director and member of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, is heading an Independent Review Board to assess the agency’s investigation of why the heat shield on the Orion spacecraft lost so much material during the 2022 uncrewed Artemis I test flight. NASA has been trying to understand why the heat shield behaved differently than expected as it prepares for the first flight with a crew. NASA’s Office of Inspector General recently released a report identifying the heat shield as a pacing item for that flight, currently scheduled for September 2025. Built by Lockheed Martin, the Orion capsule is protected by an ablative coating, Avcoat, that intentionally peels off or chars from the heat of reentry. During the Artemis I test flight, however, it eroded in an unexpected manner as the capsule plummeted through Earth’s atmosphere on December 11, 2022 at nearly 25,000 miles per hour. The May 1, 2024 report from the NASA OIG revealed that at more than 100 locations “portions of the char layer wore away differently than NASA engineers predicted, cracking and breaking off the spacecraft in fragments that created a trail of debris rather than melting away as designed.” The heat shield successfully protected the module and its systems, but the anomalous behavior “creates a risk that the heat shield may not sufficiently protect the capsule’s systems and crew from the extreme heat of reentry on future missions.” At an April 26 meeting of the NASA Advisory Council’s Human Exploration and Operations Committee, Amit Kshastriya, who heads NASA’s Moon to Mars program, said NASA is determined to understand what happened on that mission, which used a “skip-return” trajectory, and how the heat shield might respond to other types of trajectories. They have been told by the top levels of the agency to “not worry about building flight rationale,” but “make sure you understand the fundamental physics of what’s happening.” In fact, NASA established an Independent Review Board (IRB) in April to take an unbiased look at the heat shield investigation. In an emailed statement, NASA said: “In late April, NASA chartered an independent review team which includes experts outside the agency to conduct an independent evaluation of the investigation results. That review, scheduled to be complete this summer, ensures NASA properly understands this condition and has corrective actions in place for Artemis II and future missions.” Today, NASA told SpacePolicyOnline.com that the IRB is headed by Paul Hill. The independent review team of NASA’s investigation into the Artemis I Orion heat shield is being led by Paul Hill. He served as the lead space shuttle flight director for Return to Flight after the Columbia accident, led NASA’s mission operations directorate, and is a current member of the agency’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, though his role as chair is not associated with his ASAP membership. — NASA As a test flight, Artemis II will go around the Moon, but not orbit or land. Instead it will be on a “free return” trajectory that will bring the spacecraft and its four person crew back to Earth even if the engines do not work properly. Artemis II had been scheduled for this year, but in January NASA announced a one-year delay along with a similar slip for Artemis III, the first mission to put astronauts on the lunar surface since the Apollo program. Artemis II is now planned for September 2025 and Artemis III for September 2026. The OIG said NASA will spend $55 billion on the Artemis program by the time of Artemis II. Artemis, named for Apollo’s twin sister in Greek mythology, is the most recent U.S. program to return astronauts to the Moon. Previous attempts fell victim to budget constraints and changing political environments. President Trump restored the goal of putting U.S. astronauts back on the Moon in 2017 (the Obama Administration eschewed the Moon, focusing instead on human trips to Mars in the 2030s) and in March 2019 Vice President Pence, as chair of the National Space Council, abruptly set 2024 as the target date. President Biden maintained that goal when he took office in 2021, but the date slipped to 2025 and then 2026. Many are skeptical that even 2026 is possible. Understanding what happened to the heat shield is only one of several issues identifed by the OIG as needing resolution before Artemis II can fly and Artemis III requires development of a Human Landing System to get astronauts from lunar orbit down to and back from the surface. NASA’s Space Launch System rocket and Orion will get them only to lunar orbit, NASA is procuring HLS systems through Public-Private Partnerships with Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin. SpaceX is under contract for the first two human landing missions, Artemis III and Artemis IV, using a lunar version of its Starship, which is still in development. The contract requires SpaceX to conduct an uncrewed test flight of Starship HLS before using it for a crew. NASA’s current Artemis manifest shows that flight in 2026, the same year as the Artemis III landing. Even if Starship HLS is ready for an uncrewed test flight less than two years from now, test flights often uncover unexpected problems, just like Artemis I did. The likelihood that the test flight, which requires refueling in Earth orbit, will be sufficiently flawless to convince NASA to put people on board just a few months later seems pretty low.",

      "For the second week, all eyes are on the forthcoming maiden crewed flight test (CFT) of Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft. The first attempt was stood down last Monday following concerns with a liquid oxygen relief valve on the Centaur second stage. The launch will be reattempted this Friday and will be the 100th overall mission for the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket, and the first time the vehicle has carried crew. This CFT mission will also be the first crewed launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station since the Apollo era. Leading into this week, many in the northern hemisphere were treated to captivating views of a rare aurora on Friday night, caused by a level 5 geomagnetic storm — the first of this extreme G5 level since 2003. NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory noted an X-class solar flare (X5.8) on May 10. Despite concerns of disruptions to communications and GPS as the flares disturbed that layer of our atmosphere, satellites in low-Earth orbit appeared to fare better than expected. SpaceX confirmed on Monday morning that all Starlink satellites on orbit remain healthy after weathering the storm. The electrical discharge briefly disrupted most long-distance shortwave radio signals but ham radio operators could enjoy temporarily reaching further distances than usual this week. This will be due to the ionized atmosphere reflecting more radio waves back to Earth rather than losing them to space. One launch took place during this period — a Chang Zheng 4C successfully deployed Shiyan-23 to orbit from China. SpaceX will launch its 50th Falcon 9 mission of the year on its first launch of the week. At the time of publishing, SpaceX has three Falcon 9 missions planned, carrying two Starlink missions and another for the National Reconnaissance Office. While details are classified, this is known to be the first of a new proliferated spy satellite constellation, delivered by SpaceX and Northrop Grumman. The second of these Starlink missions currently has a launch window less than two hours after the Starliner launch, making it a busy night at the Cape. Next week will be the fifth anniversary of the first batch of test Starlink satellites being deployed. The network, which now has 2.7 million subscribers across 75 countries and counting, is currently forecast to be on track to produce $6.6 billion in revenue by the end of the year. There will have been 96 orbital launch attempts worldwide so far this year as the week closes — this is 29 more than the equivalent point last year and over double the year before. Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 8-7 Despite what the mission numbering might suggest, as they are not always launched sequentially, this will be the third launch of Starlink satellites into the Group 8 shell. The launch is scheduled for 9:29 AM PDT (16:29 UTC) on Tuesday, May 14 from the pad at SLC-4E at the Vandenberg Space Force Base. This will be the company’s 50th Falcon 9 launch of the year so far. The booster has not yet been officially declared, and will land on the autonomous droneship Of Course I Still Love You. The most likely candidates are B1063-18 and B1075-11 which are both refurbished and awaiting assignment. Payloads on Group 8 missions have, to date, included a mix of Starlink v2 Mini satellites, and the heavier Direct to Cell variants — these have an advanced modem on board that enables cellphones to communicate directly with them, acting as a cellphone tower in space. The payload on this mission is expected to be deployed into an initial orbit of 336 by 345 kilometers, inclined 53 degrees after which the satellites will raise themselves to around 535 kilometers in altitude. The previous mission, Group 8-2, was stood down for a day before deploying 20 satellites, of which 13 were the new variant. At the start of the week and before this launch, SpaceX had launched a total of 6,393 Starlink satellites, of which 5,233 have moved into their operational orbits and 415 have re-entered. Soyuz 2.1b | Cosmos 2576 (Unknown Payload) A launch of a Soyuz 2.1b is anticipated from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia from 20:00 UTC on Tuesday, May 16. The window extends to May 26 according to exclusion zone notices that indicate an impact zone in the Barents Sea. No details for the payload are currently available, which is anticipated to be targeting a polar orbit. Atlas V N22 | Starliner CFT The highly anticipated maiden crewed launch of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft was originally scheduled to take place from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Monday, May 6. This first launch attempt was scrubbed due to a problem with a liquid oxygen relief valve on the Centaur second stage of the Atlas V rocket. This valve had produced an audible rattling that was discussed on comms during the live stream and eventually led to Launch Director Tom Heter III making the decision not to proceed with the launch out of an abundance of caution. ULA noted in the post-scrub briefing that it had observed oscillation issues with this particular valve on five previous missions which, being uncrewed, had not prevented a launch. The vehicle was returned to the vertical integration facility to replace the valve. The 52-meter-tall stack with the Starliner capsule atop an Atlas V N22 launch vehicle will soon be rolled back out to the pad at SLC-41 for its second launch attempt. This launch is now scheduled for Friday, May 7 at 6:16 PM EDT (22:16 UTC). SC3 Calypso is making its second flight into space, having already chalked up two days of flight time on the uncrewed orbital flight test (OFT-1) mission in December 2019. This CFT mission will achieve several milestones. It is the first crewed launch of this new vehicle, the first from the pad at SLC-41, and the first from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station since the launch of Apollo 7 in 1968. This will also be the 100th mission launched by the Atlas V rocket family, the first time an Atlas V carries a crewed spacecraft and the first crewed mission for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program that isn’t conducted with a SpaceX capsule. The two experienced NASA astronauts onboard are Commander Barry “Butch” Willmore and Pilot Sunita “Suni” Williams, who will become the first woman to fly on a maiden flight of a new orbital vehicle. Suni named the spacecraft to acknowledge her love of the ocean and Jacques Cousteau’s ship which bore the same name. The N22 configuration of the Atlas V has no fairings, two side boosters, and two RL-10A engines on the Centaur upper stage. Starliner will separate around 15 minutes after launch, following the jettison of the nosecone “ascent cover” and aeroskirt. It will then continue the journey towards the International Space Station (ISS) using its thrusters on the service module. This will be the first time this capsule has docked with the ISS — the SC2 vehicle was previously the only Starliner capsule to do this on the OFT-2 demonstration mission. SC3 Calypso is expected to dock at the forward port of the Station’s Harmony module on May 8 at 04:48 UTC and will stay at the station for around seven days. Once complete, this mission will certify the vehicle for the regular crew rotation missions to the ISS awarded to SpaceX and Boeing ten years ago as part of the Commercial Crew Program. To date, SpaceX has conducted eight operational crew missions to the ISS under this contract. Starliner will provide the redundancy sought by NASA when it awarded the contract to the two providers. Once certified, NASA will drop to one Crew Dragon launch per year and alternate crew rotations between the two vehicles, although SpaceX will also be flying Dragon for additional private missions such as Axiom-4 and Polaris Dawn. With a diameter of 4.56 meters, Starliner is a little smaller than the Orion capsule used on Artemis missions and slightly larger than Crew Dragon and the Apollo command module. The capsule will typically carry up to four astronauts, with a mix of crew and cargo on each flight. All remaining Atlas launches are already allocated ahead of the vehicle being retired in around eight years. Six of these launches are set aside for Starliner’s missions for NASA to the ISS, as well as Kuiper missions. Starliner could then fly on Vulcan if that vehicle has been certified as human-rated by the time Starliner’s first six flights on Atlas V are complete. Boeing Space is already working to prepare the SC2 crew module that flew the OFT-2 mission for the forthcoming Starliner-1 crew mission in 2025. Starliner-1 will stay in orbit for approximately six months. Calypso is then expected to support the second and fourth Starliner crewed missions from 2026 onwards. Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 6-59 The second scheduled Starlink mission of the week is currently set to follow less than two hours after the planned launch of Starliner CFT. Lift-off is planned for Friday. May 17 at 7:52 PM EDT (23:52 UTC) from either SLC-40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Base or SLC-39a at the Kennedy Space Center. There is a typical four-hour launch window in which to launch this batch of Starlink v2 Mini satellites into low-Earth orbit. With details still emerging, the booster is not yet assigned, nor is the autonomous drone ship on which it will land, around 600 kilometers further downrange. Falcon 9 Block 5 | NROL-146 A Falcon 9 is scheduled to launch no earlier than Sunday, May 19 from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, carrying a classified mission for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). Details are understandably limited for the payload aboard this NROL-146 mission but it is understood this will be the first of up to six batches to launch this year into a new satellite imaging constellation. The NRO awarded SpaceX and Northrop Grumman the $1.8 billion contract to build these satellites in 2021. The NRO’s principal deputy director, Troy Meink told a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee’s subcommittee on strategic forces that this will be the first operational launch of the NRO’s new proliferated architecture, noting that demonstrations on previous NROL launches had established a comfortable sense of cost and performance. While the agency has not disclosed details of the projected constellation size, nor the number of satellites in this first payload, it has suggested this project could provide a ten-fold increase in intelligence gathering and that it will quadruple the number of satellites it has in orbit. The booster for this mission has not yet been officially declared. It is expected to land on the autonomous droneship Of Course I Still Love You.

The launch will be reattempted this Friday and will be the 100th overall mission for the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket, and the first time the vehicle has carried crew. SpaceX will launch its 50th Falcon 9 mission of the year on its first launch of the week. The second of these Starlink missions currently has a launch window less than two hours after the Starliner launch, making it a busy night at the Cape.",

      "For the second week, all eyes are on the forthcoming maiden crewed flight test (CFT) of Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft. The first attempt was stood down last Monday following concerns with a liquid oxygen relief valve on the Centaur second stage. The launch will be reattempted this Friday and will be the 100th overall mission for the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket, and the first time the vehicle has carried crew. This CFT mission will also be the first crewed launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station since the Apollo era.",

      'It has been nearly four years since the US Air Force made its selections for companies to launch military payloads during the mid-2020s. The military chose United Launch Alliance, and its Vulcan rocket, to launch 60 percent of these missions; and it chose SpaceX, with the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy boosters, to launch 40 percent. Although the large Vulcan rocket was still in development at the time, it was expected to take flight within the next year or so. Upon making the award, an Air Force official said the military believed Vulcan would soon be ready to take flight. United Launch Alliance was developing the Vulcan rocket in order to no longer be reliant on RD-180 engines that are built in Russia and used by its Atlas V rocket. "I am very confident with the selection that we have made today," William Roper, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology, and logistics, said at the time. "We have a very low-risk path to get off the RD-180 engines." As part of the announcement, Roper disclosed the first two missions that would fly on Vulcan. The USSF-51 mission was scheduled for launch in the first quarter of 2022, and the USSF-106 mission was scheduled for launch in the third quarter of 2022. “I am growing concerned” It turned out to not be such a low-risk path. The Vulcan rocket\'s development, of course, has since been delayed. It did not make its debut in 2020 or 2021 and only finally took flight in January of this year. The mission was completely successful—an impressive feat for a new rocket with new engines—but United Launch Alliance still must complete a second flight before the US military certifies Vulcan for its payloads. Advertisement Due to these delays, the USSF-51 mission was ultimately moved off of Vulcan and onto an Atlas V rocket. It is scheduled to launch no earlier than next month. The USSF-106 mission remains manifested on a Vulcan as that rocket\'s first national security mission, but its launch date is uncertain. For several years there have been rumblings about Air Force and Space Force officials being unhappy with the delays by United Launch Alliance, as well as with Blue Origin, which is building the BE-4 rocket engines that power Vulcan\'s first stage. However, these concerns have rarely broken into public view. That changed Monday when The Washington Post reported on a letter from Air Force Assistant Secretary Frank Calvelli to the co-owners of United Launch Alliance, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. In the letter sent on May 10, a copy of which was obtained by Ars, Calvelli urges the two large aerospace contractors to get moving on certification and production of the Vulcan rocket. "I am growing concerned with ULA’s ability to scale manufacturing of its Vulcan rocket and scale its launch cadence to meet our needs," Calvelli wrote. "Currently there is military satellite capability sitting on the ground due to Vulcan delays. ULA has a backlog of 25 National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 Vulcan launches on contract." These 25 launches, Calvelli notes, are due to be completed by the end of 2027. He asked Boeing and Lockheed to complete an "independent review" of United Launch Alliance\'s ability to scale manufacturing of its Vulcan rockets and meet its commitments to the military. Calvelli also noted that Vulcan has made commitments to launch dozens of satellites for others over that period, a reference to a contract between United Launch Alliance and Amazon for Project Kuiper satellites. It’s difficult to scale Calvelli\'s letter comes at a dynamic moment for United Launch Alliance. This week the company is set to launch the most critical mission in its 20-year history: two astronauts flying inside Boeing\'s Starliner spacecraft. This mission may take place as early as Friday evening from Florida on an Atlas V vehicle. Advertisement In addition, the company is for sale. Ars reported in February that Blue Origin, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, is the leading candidate to buy United Launch Alliance. It is plausible that Calvelli\'s letter was written with the intent of signaling to a buyer that the government would not object to a sale in the best interests of furthering Vulcan\'s development. But the message here is unequivocally that the government wants United Launch Alliance to remain competitive and get Vulcan flying safely and frequently. That may be easier said than done. Vulcan\'s second certification mission was supposed to be the launch of the Dream Chaser spacecraft this summer. However, as Ars reported last month, that mission will no longer fly before at least September, if not later, because the spacecraft is not ready for its debut. As a result, Space News reported on Monday that United Launch Alliance is increasingly likely to fly a mass simulator on the rocket\'s second flight later this year. After certification, United Launch Alliance can begin to fly military missions. However, it is one thing to build one or two rockets, it is quite another to build them at scale. The company\'s goal is to reach a cadence of two Vulcan launches a month by the end of 2025. In his letter, Calvelli mentioned that United Launch Alliance has averaged fewer than six launches a year during the last five years. This indicates a concern that such a goal may be unreasonable. "History shows that new rockets struggle to scale their launch cadence in their early years," Caleb Henry, director of research at Quilty Space, told Ars. "Based on the number of missions the Department of Defense requires of ULA between now and 2027, precedent says Calvelli’s concerns are justified."',
