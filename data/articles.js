      "WASHINGTON — NASA has picked four Earth science mission proposals for further study while separately selecting a smaller Earth science technology demonstration mission for development. NASA said May 7 it selected four proposals for its first Earth System Explorer missions for initial Phase A studies, lasting one year. Each of the proposed missions will receive $5 million from the agency to carry out the studies to refine their mission designs. NASA will then select two of the proposals for development. One of the selected missions would launch by 2030 and the other by 2032. Each mission will have a cost cap of $310 million, excluding launch. The four mission proposals NASA selected for study are: Stratosphere Troposphere Response using Infrared Vertically-Resolved Light Explorer (STRIVE), which will measure temperature, composition and aerosols from the upper troposphere to the mesosphere; Ocean Dynamics and Surface Exchange with the Atmosphere (ODYSEA), a mission to simultaneously measure ocean currents and winds to better understand interactions between the ocean and atmosphere; Earth Dynamics Geodetic Explorer (EDGE), which will provide three-dimensional structures of terrestrial ecosystems, including measuring glaciers, ice sheets and sea ice; and The Carbon Investigation (Carbon-I), a mission to provide measurements of various greenhouse gases, including natural and human-made sources, to better understand the carbon cycle. The missions will be the first for the Earth System Explorer program, which NASA established in response to the 2018 Earth science decal survey. That report recommended NASA develop a line of competed missions that are less expensive that directed Earth science missions but larger than its Earth Venture line of smallsat missions and instruments. NASA had planned to start the program as early as 2020 but delayed it because of budget constraints. “The proposals represent another example of NASA’s holistic approach to studying our home planet,” Nicky Fox, NASA’s associate administrator for science, said in a statement. “As we continue to confront our changing climate, and its impacts on humans and our environment, the need for data and scientific research could not be greater.” NASA officials said in a town hall meeting in March that they would spread out the cadence of announcements of opportunity (AOs) for Earth System Explorer and Earth Venture projects to avoid overloading institutions interested in those programs with simultaneous calls for proposals. A chart shown in that meeting indicated that the next Earth System Explorer AO would be released in 2029 for a mission launching in 2037. In addition to Earth System Explorer and Earth Venture programs, NASA plans to compete a mission for part of its restructured Earth System Observatory. That restructuring involves splitting large missions into several smaller, less expensive ones whose launches will be spread out. The competed mission, called Atmosphere Observing System – Cloud (AOS-Cloud), would have a cost cap excluding launch of $400 million and launch readiness date of 2031, according to a community announcement released by NASA in April announcing its plans for the upcoming competition. NASA is separately moving forward on a smaller Earth science technology demonstration mission. The agency has selected the Gravitational Reference Advanced Technology Test In Space (GRATTIS) mission, led by the University of Florida, for development and launch. The $12 million mission will test a new sensor proposed for use on future missions to measure the Earth’s gravitational field. “Our technology will provide vital insights into the movement of water and ice across the planet,” John Conklin, principal investigator of GRATTIS at the University of Florida, in a statement. “This data is essential for monitoring droughts, assessing groundwater reserves, and understanding the impact of melting ice sheets on sea levels.” GRATTIS will use an Aries spacecraft bus provided by Apex Space and will launch on a SpaceX Transporter rideshare mission no earlier than October 2026.",

      "HELSINKI — India is developing plans for its Chandrayaan-4 moon sample return mission that will include the country’s emerging private sector. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is working on plans for the moon sample return as part of its followup to last year’s successful Chandrayaan-3 lunar landing. The multi-launch, multi-spacecraft mission would aim to land at Shiv Shakti Point, the landing site of Chandrayaan-3. The aim is to collect an unspecified mass of lunar samples and deliver them to Earth. Nilesh Desai, Director of the Space Applications Centre (SAC), revealed the details in a presentation marking National Technology Day at SAC in Ahmedabad. “We are working on that and hopefully in the next four or five years or so. This also opens up many new technologies. The private sector also is going to be involved in a big way,” Desai said. India has made a series of efforts to foster a private space sector, including a new national space policy introduced in 2023. Leveraging this for a flagship mission would be another such move. The country is also chasing a surge in civil and private launches in the near future. The Chandrayaan-4 mission will be complex. Two separate launch vehicles to launch four spacecraft: A PSLV and a LVM-3. The former will send a transfer module (TM) and reentry module (RM) into a sub-geostationary transfer orbit, gradually raising to lunar distance. The latter will launch a lander module (LM) and ascender module (AM). A propulsion module will assist the latter pair. The RM and TM will park in lunar orbit while the LM and AM descend to the moon. Operations on the lunar surface will take place within a single lunar day. A robotic arm will transfer collected samples to the AM. This will then launch into lunar orbit to rendezvous with the TM. A robotic arm aboard the TM will transfer samples to the RM before heading to Earth. The RM will then separate from the TM close to Earth for reentry and landing. It is unclear if funding for the mission has been secured, but ISRO plans state it would launch no earlier than 2028. As the mission profile includes lunar orbit rendezvous and docking techniques, rather than a direct return of samples to Earth, it would also have applicability for future crewed lunar missions. India Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October 2023 announced a 2040 target for putting astronauts on the moon. ISRO Chairman S. Somanath last year gave a presentation with Chandrayaan-4 as part of a roadmap envisioning Indian astronauts on the moon and a base around 2047. Indian Moon base in the 2040s? ISRO chairman S. Somanath gave a lecture at ISG-ISRS 2023, outlining an integrated lunar exploration roadmap with the long term plan of a lunar base around 2047. Reiterates plan announced last month for a crewed lunar landing by 2040. Ambitious. pic.twitter.com/GS4HU8BOiz — Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) November 30, 2023 India is also working on the Lunar Polar Exploration (LuPEx) mission with Japan. That is to consist of an ISRO lander and a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) rover to explore permanently shadowed craters. The mission will launch on a Japanese H3 rocket. ISRO’s own part in the mission is again unclear in terms of budget and approval. India’s suggested launch dates appear to be later than those in Japanese statements. The mission will aim to land at exactly 90 degrees at the lunar south pole, Desai said. Desai also touched on plans for a Mars Lander Mission (MLM), a followup to the 2013 Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM). “Going there for nine months and then landing, that is the biggest challenge,” Desai noted. He also listed critical technologies for the mission as a supersonic parachute, aerodynamic design for landing, and a sky-crane for lander deployment. An LVM-3 would launch MLM, while a relay satellite would be launched on a PSLV. A range of proposed science payloads for a mission rover include a ground-penetrating radar, mineral-mapping spectrometers, a raman spectrometer for seeking biosignatures, a range of cameras and an in-situ resource utilization instrument. India’s MOM mission made it the first Asian nation to put a spacecraft in Mars orbit. Only the United States and China have successfully landed and operated rovers on Mars.",

      "WASHINGTON — European space company OHB expects to wrap up a deal with investment company KKR to go private within the next several weeks as it prepares for two key launches this summer. Marco Fuchs, chief executive of OHB, said in a May 8 earnings call that all that was left to complete a deal with KKR announced in August to take the company private was final regulatory approvals in two countries, Belgium and Germany. He said he expected those countries to sign off on the deal soon. “We don’t see this as a concern,” he said of the pending approvals. “We feel that this will be completed in the next weeks and we feel that everything should be finalized before our annual meeting at the end of June.” Under the deal, KKR offered to buy shares on the public market not owned by the Fuchs family, which maintains a controlling stake in the company, for 44 euros ($47.50) per share. As of November, KKR and the Fuchs family owned 94% of all OHB shares. Fuchs said in November that the reason for the deal was to take the company private, arguing that smaller companies like OHB are “structurally undervalued” on public markets. He said in the earnings call that he expected OHB to delist from public exchanges once the company received the remaining regulatory approvals. The conclusion of that deal comes as OHB is involved with the first launches of two new rockets in the next several months. Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA), a launch vehicle company spun out of OHB in 2018, is preparing for the first launch of its RFA ONE rocket from SaxaVord Spaceport in the Shetland Islands. Fuchs said that RFA is gearing up for hotfire tests of the rocket’s first stage at the spaceport soon. “We are still working under the assumption that we have a launch late in the summer,” he said, with a current no-earlier-than launch date of Aug. 1. OHB is also a supplier for the Ariane 6, whose first launch is slated for this summer as well. “We are very confident that Ariane 6 will launch within the known launch period from mid-June through the end of July,” he said. “I think preparations are going very well.” Another Ariane 6 contractor, Avio, offered a similar assessment in its earnings call May 9, projecting a launch some time in July. Neither the prime contractor, ArianeGroup, not the European Space Agency have announced a more specific launch date for the long-delayed inaugural flight of the rocket. The company also played down reports in German media that the German government was unhappy with the contract being negotiated by the European Commission with an industrial consortium that includes OHB for the Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnectivity and Security by Satellite (IRIS²) constellation. According to one report, a German minister wrote to EU officials criticizing the management of IRIS² and it scosts, which he claimed was now approaching 12 billion euros, nearly double earlier estimates. Commission officials had expected early this year to finalize a contract with the consortium by the end of March. However, that contract has not been signed and, in April, Theirry Breton, EU commissioner for the internal market, said only that the evaluation of the contract was ongoing. He did not estimate when that work would be completed. “I don’t think politics is the major delay for this one. It’s a very complex project,” said Markus Moeller, OHB’s chief strategy and business development officer, on the call. “There’s always politics in the background — it’s a federal program for Europe — but on the other hand, the delays that we see are delays that could be expected in a program of that scale.” OHB reported revenues of 206.7 million euros in the first quarter, 2% more than the same quarter a year ago. Net profit, though, was down 24% at 7.08 million euros. The company maintained its projection of 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion euros of revenue for the full year. The revenue OHB reported was a first-quarter record for the company, but Fuchs sounded underwhelmed. “It didn’t feel very exciting, this number,” he said on the call.",

      "Paul Hill, a former NASA space shuttle flight director and member of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, is heading an Independent Review Board to assess the agency’s investigation of why the heat shield on the Orion spacecraft lost so much material during the 2022 uncrewed Artemis I test flight. NASA has been trying to understand why the heat shield behaved differently than expected as it prepares for the first flight with a crew. NASA’s Office of Inspector General recently released a report identifying the heat shield as a pacing item for that flight, currently scheduled for September 2025. Built by Lockheed Martin, the Orion capsule is protected by an ablative coating, Avcoat, that intentionally peels off or chars from the heat of reentry. During the Artemis I test flight, however, it eroded in an unexpected manner as the capsule plummeted through Earth’s atmosphere on December 11, 2022 at nearly 25,000 miles per hour. The May 1, 2024 report from the NASA OIG revealed that at more than 100 locations “portions of the char layer wore away differently than NASA engineers predicted, cracking and breaking off the spacecraft in fragments that created a trail of debris rather than melting away as designed.” The heat shield successfully protected the module and its systems, but the anomalous behavior “creates a risk that the heat shield may not sufficiently protect the capsule’s systems and crew from the extreme heat of reentry on future missions.” At an April 26 meeting of the NASA Advisory Council’s Human Exploration and Operations Committee, Amit Kshastriya, who heads NASA’s Moon to Mars program, said NASA is determined to understand what happened on that mission, which used a “skip-return” trajectory, and how the heat shield might respond to other types of trajectories. They have been told by the top levels of the agency to “not worry about building flight rationale,” but “make sure you understand the fundamental physics of what’s happening.” In fact, NASA established an Independent Review Board (IRB) in April to take an unbiased look at the heat shield investigation. In an emailed statement, NASA said: “In late April, NASA chartered an independent review team which includes experts outside the agency to conduct an independent evaluation of the investigation results. That review, scheduled to be complete this summer, ensures NASA properly understands this condition and has corrective actions in place for Artemis II and future missions.” Today, NASA told SpacePolicyOnline.com that the IRB is headed by Paul Hill. The independent review team of NASA’s investigation into the Artemis I Orion heat shield is being led by Paul Hill. He served as the lead space shuttle flight director for Return to Flight after the Columbia accident, led NASA’s mission operations directorate, and is a current member of the agency’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, though his role as chair is not associated with his ASAP membership. — NASA As a test flight, Artemis II will go around the Moon, but not orbit or land. Instead it will be on a “free return” trajectory that will bring the spacecraft and its four person crew back to Earth even if the engines do not work properly. Artemis II had been scheduled for this year, but in January NASA announced a one-year delay along with a similar slip for Artemis III, the first mission to put astronauts on the lunar surface since the Apollo program. Artemis II is now planned for September 2025 and Artemis III for September 2026. The OIG said NASA will spend $55 billion on the Artemis program by the time of Artemis II. Artemis, named for Apollo’s twin sister in Greek mythology, is the most recent U.S. program to return astronauts to the Moon. Previous attempts fell victim to budget constraints and changing political environments. President Trump restored the goal of putting U.S. astronauts back on the Moon in 2017 (the Obama Administration eschewed the Moon, focusing instead on human trips to Mars in the 2030s) and in March 2019 Vice President Pence, as chair of the National Space Council, abruptly set 2024 as the target date. President Biden maintained that goal when he took office in 2021, but the date slipped to 2025 and then 2026. Many are skeptical that even 2026 is possible. Understanding what happened to the heat shield is only one of several issues identifed by the OIG as needing resolution before Artemis II can fly and Artemis III requires development of a Human Landing System to get astronauts from lunar orbit down to and back from the surface. NASA’s Space Launch System rocket and Orion will get them only to lunar orbit, NASA is procuring HLS systems through Public-Private Partnerships with Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin. SpaceX is under contract for the first two human landing missions, Artemis III and Artemis IV, using a lunar version of its Starship, which is still in development. The contract requires SpaceX to conduct an uncrewed test flight of Starship HLS before using it for a crew. NASA’s current Artemis manifest shows that flight in 2026, the same year as the Artemis III landing. Even if Starship HLS is ready for an uncrewed test flight less than two years from now, test flights often uncover unexpected problems, just like Artemis I did. The likelihood that the test flight, which requires refueling in Earth orbit, will be sufficiently flawless to convince NASA to put people on board just a few months later seems pretty low.",

      "For the second week, all eyes are on the forthcoming maiden crewed flight test (CFT) of Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft. The first attempt was stood down last Monday following concerns with a liquid oxygen relief valve on the Centaur second stage. The launch will be reattempted this Friday and will be the 100th overall mission for the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket, and the first time the vehicle has carried crew. This CFT mission will also be the first crewed launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station since the Apollo era. Leading into this week, many in the northern hemisphere were treated to captivating views of a rare aurora on Friday night, caused by a level 5 geomagnetic storm — the first of this extreme G5 level since 2003. NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory noted an X-class solar flare (X5.8) on May 10. Despite concerns of disruptions to communications and GPS as the flares disturbed that layer of our atmosphere, satellites in low-Earth orbit appeared to fare better than expected. SpaceX confirmed on Monday morning that all Starlink satellites on orbit remain healthy after weathering the storm. The electrical discharge briefly disrupted most long-distance shortwave radio signals but ham radio operators could enjoy temporarily reaching further distances than usual this week. This will be due to the ionized atmosphere reflecting more radio waves back to Earth rather than losing them to space. One launch took place during this period — a Chang Zheng 4C successfully deployed Shiyan-23 to orbit from China. SpaceX will launch its 50th Falcon 9 mission of the year on its first launch of the week. At the time of publishing, SpaceX has three Falcon 9 missions planned, carrying two Starlink missions and another for the National Reconnaissance Office. While details are classified, this is known to be the first of a new proliferated spy satellite constellation, delivered by SpaceX and Northrop Grumman. The second of these Starlink missions currently has a launch window less than two hours after the Starliner launch, making it a busy night at the Cape. Next week will be the fifth anniversary of the first batch of test Starlink satellites being deployed. The network, which now has 2.7 million subscribers across 75 countries and counting, is currently forecast to be on track to produce $6.6 billion in revenue by the end of the year. There will have been 96 orbital launch attempts worldwide so far this year as the week closes — this is 29 more than the equivalent point last year and over double the year before. Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 8-7 Despite what the mission numbering might suggest, as they are not always launched sequentially, this will be the third launch of Starlink satellites into the Group 8 shell. The launch is scheduled for 9:29 AM PDT (16:29 UTC) on Tuesday, May 14 from the pad at SLC-4E at the Vandenberg Space Force Base. This will be the company’s 50th Falcon 9 launch of the year so far. The booster has not yet been officially declared, and will land on the autonomous droneship Of Course I Still Love You. The most likely candidates are B1063-18 and B1075-11 which are both refurbished and awaiting assignment. Payloads on Group 8 missions have, to date, included a mix of Starlink v2 Mini satellites, and the heavier Direct to Cell variants — these have an advanced modem on board that enables cellphones to communicate directly with them, acting as a cellphone tower in space. The payload on this mission is expected to be deployed into an initial orbit of 336 by 345 kilometers, inclined 53 degrees after which the satellites will raise themselves to around 535 kilometers in altitude. The previous mission, Group 8-2, was stood down for a day before deploying 20 satellites, of which 13 were the new variant. At the start of the week and before this launch, SpaceX had launched a total of 6,393 Starlink satellites, of which 5,233 have moved into their operational orbits and 415 have re-entered. Soyuz 2.1b | Cosmos 2576 (Unknown Payload) A launch of a Soyuz 2.1b is anticipated from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia from 20:00 UTC on Tuesday, May 16. The window extends to May 26 according to exclusion zone notices that indicate an impact zone in the Barents Sea. No details for the payload are currently available, which is anticipated to be targeting a polar orbit. Atlas V N22 | Starliner CFT The highly anticipated maiden crewed launch of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft was originally scheduled to take place from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Monday, May 6. This first launch attempt was scrubbed due to a problem with a liquid oxygen relief valve on the Centaur second stage of the Atlas V rocket. This valve had produced an audible rattling that was discussed on comms during the live stream and eventually led to Launch Director Tom Heter III making the decision not to proceed with the launch out of an abundance of caution. ULA noted in the post-scrub briefing that it had observed oscillation issues with this particular valve on five previous missions which, being uncrewed, had not prevented a launch. The vehicle was returned to the vertical integration facility to replace the valve. The 52-meter-tall stack with the Starliner capsule atop an Atlas V N22 launch vehicle will soon be rolled back out to the pad at SLC-41 for its second launch attempt. This launch is now scheduled for Friday, May 7 at 6:16 PM EDT (22:16 UTC). SC3 Calypso is making its second flight into space, having already chalked up two days of flight time on the uncrewed orbital flight test (OFT-1) mission in December 2019. This CFT mission will achieve several milestones. It is the first crewed launch of this new vehicle, the first from the pad at SLC-41, and the first from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station since the launch of Apollo 7 in 1968. This will also be the 100th mission launched by the Atlas V rocket family, the first time an Atlas V carries a crewed spacecraft and the first crewed mission for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program that isn’t conducted with a SpaceX capsule. The two experienced NASA astronauts onboard are Commander Barry “Butch” Willmore and Pilot Sunita “Suni” Williams, who will become the first woman to fly on a maiden flight of a new orbital vehicle. Suni named the spacecraft to acknowledge her love of the ocean and Jacques Cousteau’s ship which bore the same name. The N22 configuration of the Atlas V has no fairings, two side boosters, and two RL-10A engines on the Centaur upper stage. Starliner will separate around 15 minutes after launch, following the jettison of the nosecone “ascent cover” and aeroskirt. It will then continue the journey towards the International Space Station (ISS) using its thrusters on the service module. This will be the first time this capsule has docked with the ISS — the SC2 vehicle was previously the only Starliner capsule to do this on the OFT-2 demonstration mission. SC3 Calypso is expected to dock at the forward port of the Station’s Harmony module on May 8 at 04:48 UTC and will stay at the station for around seven days. Once complete, this mission will certify the vehicle for the regular crew rotation missions to the ISS awarded to SpaceX and Boeing ten years ago as part of the Commercial Crew Program. To date, SpaceX has conducted eight operational crew missions to the ISS under this contract. Starliner will provide the redundancy sought by NASA when it awarded the contract to the two providers. Once certified, NASA will drop to one Crew Dragon launch per year and alternate crew rotations between the two vehicles, although SpaceX will also be flying Dragon for additional private missions such as Axiom-4 and Polaris Dawn. With a diameter of 4.56 meters, Starliner is a little smaller than the Orion capsule used on Artemis missions and slightly larger than Crew Dragon and the Apollo command module. The capsule will typically carry up to four astronauts, with a mix of crew and cargo on each flight. All remaining Atlas launches are already allocated ahead of the vehicle being retired in around eight years. Six of these launches are set aside for Starliner’s missions for NASA to the ISS, as well as Kuiper missions. Starliner could then fly on Vulcan if that vehicle has been certified as human-rated by the time Starliner’s first six flights on Atlas V are complete. Boeing Space is already working to prepare the SC2 crew module that flew the OFT-2 mission for the forthcoming Starliner-1 crew mission in 2025. Starliner-1 will stay in orbit for approximately six months. Calypso is then expected to support the second and fourth Starliner crewed missions from 2026 onwards. Falcon 9 Block 5 | Starlink Group 6-59 The second scheduled Starlink mission of the week is currently set to follow less than two hours after the planned launch of Starliner CFT. Lift-off is planned for Friday. May 17 at 7:52 PM EDT (23:52 UTC) from either SLC-40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Base or SLC-39a at the Kennedy Space Center. There is a typical four-hour launch window in which to launch this batch of Starlink v2 Mini satellites into low-Earth orbit. With details still emerging, the booster is not yet assigned, nor is the autonomous drone ship on which it will land, around 600 kilometers further downrange. Falcon 9 Block 5 | NROL-146 A Falcon 9 is scheduled to launch no earlier than Sunday, May 19 from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, carrying a classified mission for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). Details are understandably limited for the payload aboard this NROL-146 mission but it is understood this will be the first of up to six batches to launch this year into a new satellite imaging constellation. The NRO awarded SpaceX and Northrop Grumman the $1.8 billion contract to build these satellites in 2021. The NRO’s principal deputy director, Troy Meink told a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee’s subcommittee on strategic forces that this will be the first operational launch of the NRO’s new proliferated architecture, noting that demonstrations on previous NROL launches had established a comfortable sense of cost and performance. While the agency has not disclosed details of the projected constellation size, nor the number of satellites in this first payload, it has suggested this project could provide a ten-fold increase in intelligence gathering and that it will quadruple the number of satellites it has in orbit. The booster for this mission has not yet been officially declared. It is expected to land on the autonomous droneship Of Course I Still Love You.

      'It has been nearly four years since the US Air Force made its selections for companies to launch military payloads during the mid-2020s. The military chose United Launch Alliance, and its Vulcan rocket, to launch 60 percent of these missions; and it chose SpaceX, with the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy boosters, to launch 40 percent. Although the large Vulcan rocket was still in development at the time, it was expected to take flight within the next year or so. Upon making the award, an Air Force official said the military believed Vulcan would soon be ready to take flight. United Launch Alliance was developing the Vulcan rocket in order to no longer be reliant on RD-180 engines that are built in Russia and used by its Atlas V rocket. "I am very confident with the selection that we have made today," William Roper, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology, and logistics, said at the time. "We have a very low-risk path to get off the RD-180 engines." As part of the announcement, Roper disclosed the first two missions that would fly on Vulcan. The USSF-51 mission was scheduled for launch in the first quarter of 2022, and the USSF-106 mission was scheduled for launch in the third quarter of 2022. “I am growing concerned” It turned out to not be such a low-risk path. The Vulcan rocket\'s development, of course, has since been delayed. It did not make its debut in 2020 or 2021 and only finally took flight in January of this year. The mission was completely successful—an impressive feat for a new rocket with new engines—but United Launch Alliance still must complete a second flight before the US military certifies Vulcan for its payloads. Advertisement Due to these delays, the USSF-51 mission was ultimately moved off of Vulcan and onto an Atlas V rocket. It is scheduled to launch no earlier than next month. The USSF-106 mission remains manifested on a Vulcan as that rocket\'s first national security mission, but its launch date is uncertain. For several years there have been rumblings about Air Force and Space Force officials being unhappy with the delays by United Launch Alliance, as well as with Blue Origin, which is building the BE-4 rocket engines that power Vulcan\'s first stage. However, these concerns have rarely broken into public view. That changed Monday when The Washington Post reported on a letter from Air Force Assistant Secretary Frank Calvelli to the co-owners of United Launch Alliance, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. In the letter sent on May 10, a copy of which was obtained by Ars, Calvelli urges the two large aerospace contractors to get moving on certification and production of the Vulcan rocket. "I am growing concerned with ULA’s ability to scale manufacturing of its Vulcan rocket and scale its launch cadence to meet our needs," Calvelli wrote. "Currently there is military satellite capability sitting on the ground due to Vulcan delays. ULA has a backlog of 25 National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 Vulcan launches on contract." These 25 launches, Calvelli notes, are due to be completed by the end of 2027. He asked Boeing and Lockheed to complete an "independent review" of United Launch Alliance\'s ability to scale manufacturing of its Vulcan rockets and meet its commitments to the military. Calvelli also noted that Vulcan has made commitments to launch dozens of satellites for others over that period, a reference to a contract between United Launch Alliance and Amazon for Project Kuiper satellites. It’s difficult to scale Calvelli\'s letter comes at a dynamic moment for United Launch Alliance. This week the company is set to launch the most critical mission in its 20-year history: two astronauts flying inside Boeing\'s Starliner spacecraft. This mission may take place as early as Friday evening from Florida on an Atlas V vehicle. Advertisement In addition, the company is for sale. Ars reported in February that Blue Origin, which is owned by Jeff Bezos, is the leading candidate to buy United Launch Alliance. It is plausible that Calvelli\'s letter was written with the intent of signaling to a buyer that the government would not object to a sale in the best interests of furthering Vulcan\'s development. But the message here is unequivocally that the government wants United Launch Alliance to remain competitive and get Vulcan flying safely and frequently. That may be easier said than done. Vulcan\'s second certification mission was supposed to be the launch of the Dream Chaser spacecraft this summer. However, as Ars reported last month, that mission will no longer fly before at least September, if not later, because the spacecraft is not ready for its debut. As a result, Space News reported on Monday that United Launch Alliance is increasingly likely to fly a mass simulator on the rocket\'s second flight later this year. After certification, United Launch Alliance can begin to fly military missions. However, it is one thing to build one or two rockets, it is quite another to build them at scale. The company\'s goal is to reach a cadence of two Vulcan launches a month by the end of 2025. In his letter, Calvelli mentioned that United Launch Alliance has averaged fewer than six launches a year during the last five years. This indicates a concern that such a goal may be unreasonable. "History shows that new rockets struggle to scale their launch cadence in their early years," Caleb Henry, director of research at Quilty Space, told Ars. "Based on the number of missions the Department of Defense requires of ULA between now and 2027, precedent says Calvelli’s concerns are justified."',

      "WASHINGTON — Satellite manufacturer Terran Orbital announced May 13 that Lockheed Martin has signed a new contract to purchase 18 satellite buses. Lockheed Martin will use the satellite buses to produce 18 satellites for the Space Development Agency’s Tranche 2 Tracking Layer contract. Terran Orbital is publicizing the new contract the day before earnings, likely in an effort to reassure investors that its partnership with Lockheed Martin remains strong after the defense contractor withdrew its offer to acquire Terran Orbital. Terran Orbital issued the press release after the stock market closed on Monday. A first-quarter earnings call is scheduled for May 14. Lockheed Martin announced in January that it planned to use Terran Orbital’s satellite buses after winning an $890 million contract to produce 18 missile warning and missile tracking satellites for SDA — a U.S. Space Force agency building a constellation in low Earth orbit for the Defense Department. Terran Orbital said at the time of Lockheed Martin’s announcement the details of the agreement had not yet been finalized. “We’re proud to once again be selected as the trusted space vehicle provider for Lockheed Martin, especially for the SDA’s critical tracking mission,” said Marc Bell, Terran Orbital’s chief executive. “This continued partnership signifies the confidence Lockheed Martin places in Terran Orbital’s capabilities,” he said. Lockheed has ordered 106 buses Terran Orbital highlighted that the new agreement brings the total to 106 satellite buses under contract for Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin is a major shareholder of Terran Orbital and said in regulatory filings that its SDA satellite orders account for 81% of Terran Orbital’s backlog. The new contract announcement comes after a turbulent period for Terran Orbital. On May 2, Lockheed Martin withdrew a $500 million offer made March 1 to purchase the remaining shares of Terran Orbital for $1 each. Terran Orbital’s stock price fell sharply after Lockheed Martin called off the deal. Lockheed Martin did not publicly discuss the reason for the withdrawal. Analysts have speculated that Lockheed Martin may have had concerns about Terran Orbital’s difficulties with its Rivada Space Networks contract. Terran Orbital has a large contract with Rivada Space Networks, but hasn’t begun substantial work yet and it’s unclear if it received the $180 million it expected by the end of 2023 as a down payment on the $2.4 billion project. The company’s stock price hovered around $1.05 on May 13. As long as the share price stays above $1, the company is not in danger of being delisted from the NYSE.",

      "WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is considering allowing United Launch Alliance (ULA) to launch a mass simulator on its next Vulcan Centaur rocket flight if its planned payload, Sierra Space’s Dream Chaser, is not ready by year’s end, according to a defense official. The official said in off-the-record comments that DoD would consider certifying the Vulcan rocket if it can perform a second successful launch using a mass simulator — a stand-in for the actual payload. While Vulcan successfully completed its maiden launch in January, a second successful mission is required for Defense Department certification to fly national security missions. ULA maintains confidence that it will launch Sierra Space’s Dream Chaser space plane by October but there are concerns at high levels about ULA’s ability to get the Vulcan rocket certified and flying at the rate needed to meet its contractual obligations, the official said. Vulcan has yet to be certified nearly four years after ULA secured a multi-billion dollar contract from the U.S. Space Force to launch 60% of national security space missions. ULA spokesperson Jessica Rye said in a statement to SpaceNews that the goal remains to launch Dream Chaser to the International Space Station this fall. “While ULA will be ready to fly in mid-2024 our customer Sierra Space has requested a launch period in the beginning of September,” said Rye. “It is important for us to fly our Cert-2 mission soon since that is part of our certification program with the Space Force to fly its missions. We expect to fly Cert-2 before October 1. If our customer is not ready to fly, we have backup plans.” Calvelli calls for a review Meanwhile, the Pentagon’s worries are escalating. The Washington Post on Monday reported that Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition Frank Calvelli directly communicated with ULA’s parent companies, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, asking them to evaluate ULA’s operations and ability to meet National Security Space Launch contract obligations — a backlog of 25 missions that need to be launched by 2027. In 2020, the Space Force awarded ULA one of two National Security Space Launch Phase 2 contracts, with ULA winning 60% of its missions over five years, and SpaceX receiving the remaining 40%. Development setbacks with Vulcan forced the Space Force to adjust launch assignments, resulting in a current split of 54% for ULA and 46% for SpaceX. Over the past three years, both Assistant Secretary Calvelli and Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall have held a series of meetings with ULA representatives in an effort to understand the potential delays and their impact on the national security space launch schedule. The concern is that critical missions could be grounded for extended periods. Vulcan is a program the Air Force is deeply invested in after selecting it for the NSSL Phase 2 contract. Further, Vulcan serves a strategic purpose by replacing ULA’s Atlas 5 rocket in the national security launch fleet. This transition is mandated by a 2016 law that prohibits the U.S. military from using launch vehicles reliant on the Russian-made RD-180 engine. Vulcan’s first stage is powered by American-made BE-4 engines from Blue Origin. Ensuring competition ‘a difficult issue’ With these factors in mind, the Air Force is understandably eager for Vulcan to achieve certification and operational capability, said defense analyst Todd Harrison, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. In a report published last week, Harrison noted that ensuring competition in the National Security Space Launch program is “perhaps the most difficult space launch issue facing the United States in the coming years.” SpaceX in 2023 accounted for 93 percent of all U.S. launches and 45 percent of global launches, Harrison estimated. “SpaceX is poised to pull further ahead in the launch market once Starship becomes operational, unless and until a cost-competitive challenger emerges,” he added. Adding another layer of complexity is ULA’s potential acquisition by Blue Origin, a competitor in the space launch industry.",

      "By SpaceX successfully launched another 23 Starlink satellites to low Earth orbit on Sunday evening from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The launch took place at 8:53 pm ET while Earth was in the crosshairs of a major Solar storm. This storm caused Aurora to be seen as far South as the launch site itself, an incredibly rare occurrence. In the past, launches were delayed during significant Solar events, which could affect electronics on board orbiting spacecraft and create more drag around them, which could cause them to de-orbit before entering a higher, more stable orbit. Despite the intense storm, SpaceX reported that all of its satellites weathered the storm perfectly, including the 23 Starlink satellites launched last night. These satellites will now begin the usual post-launch checkouts as they slowly raise themselves to their operational orbit. This most recent batch was Starlink Group 6-58, which was launched into a 43-degree orbital inclination and deployed just over an hour after lift-off. As for the Falcon 9 that launched this mission, that fell to Booster 1073, which completed its 15th flight to space and back, landing on the droneship ‘A Shortfall of Gravitas’ and in a bit of a change, the SpaceX stream of the mission on X included audio of the Falcon 9 landing under the power of a single Merlin 1D engine, perhaps testing the ability to stream more bandwidth intense data from remote locations using Starlink. Falcon 9 lands on the A Shortfall of Gravitas droneship pic.twitter.com/MVr0R1ov7t — SpaceX (@SpaceX) May 13, 2024 B1073 has now launched the CRS-27 ISS resupply mission, one Bandwagon rideshare mission, the Japanese Hakuto-R Moon lander, two communications satellites, and 10 Starlink missions. This most recent launch’s success, even during a major Solar storm, showcases the robustness of the Starlink satellites. Even if it had affected them, they would be in proper orbits to de-orbit safely and not become space junk orbiting around Earth at high altitudes. Next up for SpaceX is another Starlink launch from California, currently no earlier than Tuesday at 9:29 am PT. Questions or comments?

      "The space industry has grown at an incredible rate over the past decade. Estimates project the global space economy to be worth $1. 8 trillion by 2035, a substantial increase from $630 billion in 2023. While several factors contribute to this growth, one sector particularly appealing to investors is exploiting space resources, or space mining. Recent discoveries reveal that asteroids hold valuable materials that could induce enormous profits, if utilized. For instance, asteroid Davida, located in the asteroid belt, is rich in valuable resources such as water, nickel, iron, cobalt, nitrogen, ammonia and hydrogen. Its estimated resource value is approximately $27 quintillion. According to a database provided by Asterank, many asteroid belt asteroids, such as Phaethon, Tapio, Heracles, Orchis and Pyotr Pervyj have values exceeding $100 trillion. Some of them, like Ryugu, estimated to be worth around $83 billion, may not hold significant value compared to others but can still yield high profits. In Ryugu’s case, around $30 billion. Nevertheless, arguably the most famous of all is 16 Psyche, a massive asteroid that is particularly intriguing due to its metallic composition. Its estimated worth is $10 quintillion, significantly exceeding the entire Earth’s gross domestic product. While some question the economic feasibility of space mining in the near future, it’s undeniable that the space industry is rapidly evolving. A significant reduction in launch costs by up to 95%, along with a decrease in the price of transporting goods per kilogram into space now makes these endeavors appear more tangible. In this regard, Earth’s natural satellite holds significant importance due to its proximity to our planet and abundant reserves of Helium-3 (3He), which could be used as a powerful energy resource. The Moon is estimated to hold over 1 million tons of this resource, capable of generating energy that could surpass Earth’s fossil fuel reserves tenfold. However, technical challenges remain, such as practical shortcomings in 3He extraction and fusion process adjustment. Existing fusion reactors still need to achieve the high sustainable temperatures necessary for electricity production, while refining the extraction of 3He from the lunar surface is challenging due to its very small concentration in the soil. Among diverging agendas: navigating contemporary lunar ambitions After the moon landing and the end of the Cold War, the space race briefly subsided. However, with modern research revealing that outer space is rich in resources, the aspiration to colonize Earth’s natural satellite has been reignited. China was the first nation to publicly outline its plans for moon exploration, starting with the Chang’e program launched in 2007. In an eight-step process, which includes phases from orbiting the moon to establishing a research base on it by 2036, Beijing has so far managed to complete step five, which involved China’s first lunar sample-return mission and the world’s first to the far side of the moon. The Chang’e 6 mission, planned for 2024, aims to deploy a lander designed specifically to return samples from the lunar south pole, which, according to research, would be the most suitable place for establishing a colony. The Chinese first showed interest in exploiting lunar 3He as early as 2013, suggesting that it could “satisfy human beings’ energy demand for at least 10,000 years.” Russia also announced its lunar plans, dividing it into four phases between 2016 and 2040. The first phase, expected to end in 2025, involves sending four rovers (Luna-25, Luna-26, Luna-27, and Luna-28) to the immediate vicinity of the lunar polar regions. However, the Luna 25 mission, launched on August 10, 2023, failed to successfully land on the moon’s surface due to a botched orbital maneuver. Russia sought partnerships with other countries, considering China as the most favorable candidate for future lunar mining. Well ahead of the failure of its Luna mission, and aware of China’s rapidly advancing and successful moon program, Moscow expressed interest in collaborating with Beijing on several occasions. The cooperation was eventually formalized in March 2021, when the representatives of the two countries officially signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to jointly construct an autonomous lunar permanent research base. Parties emphasized that the project will be open to all interested countries and international partners. Acknowledging the rapid development of the new space race, the United States also devised its own plan for lunar explorations in 2020. Washington proposed a multilateral partnership, known as the Artemis Accords, with an aim to establish the first long-term presence on the moon. Similar to Moscow’s and Beijing’s plans, this program is set to be executed in several stages from 2020 to 2031. So far, 39 nations have joined the initiative. As stated in the document, the Artemis Accords provides a framework for countries to cooperate on activities such as lunar exploration, resource extraction, and scientific research. Entering the vacuum: Gaps and misinterpretations of international law Existing legal frameworks for outer space regarding lunar exploitation, specifically the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) and the 1979 Moon Agreement (MA), designate the moon and its resources as the “common heritage of mankind” and “not subject to national appropriation.” However, it appears that advanced spacefaring nations interpret the matter differently. For instance, the U.S. proposal includes a contentious interpretation of the OST, stating that “the extraction of space resources does not inherently constitute national appropriation under Article II of the Outer Space Treaty.” Furthermore, despite China and Russia both advocating for the installation of a lunar station as a base for 3He utilization, they were quick to comment on the U.S.’s stance. Beijing claimed that the Accords should not be viewed as an extension of the OST, but rather as an attempt to establish norms outside existing international regulatory frameworks, while Moscow argued that this represents an attempt to monopolize outer space and take over other planets, which defies the principle of international cooperation. It’s also interesting to note that none of these three nations, which are permanent members of the Security Council of the U.N., ratified the MA, which would have regulated space mining under a multilateral regime. These kinds of arguments have led some to assert that the current space governance framework, established under the U.N.’s architecture has become outdated, prompting organizations like the European Union to intervene. Politico reports that the E.U.’s newest draft aims to establish an E.U. Space Label, encouraging entities to use orbit more responsibly. According to E.U. representatives, space companies wishing to do business with the bloc must abide by the rules. They added that the draft was shaping up to create one single market in space. However, even if this act addresses current issues concerning lunar resource exploitation, it remains uncertain whether China or Russia will comply, given the current geopolitical circumstances and the fact that Beijing has submitted its own proposal to the U.N. Moreover, considering the existing lack of a clear global regulatory framework for space property, exploitation and ownership rights, individual nations like the U.S., Japan, Luxembourg and the United Arab Emirates have established their own unique space legislation and policies, which increases the risk of inconsistent and conflicting regulations. Given the U.N.’s current inability to conclusively resolve these issues, experts believe that the evolving situation could escalate geopolitical tensions among key spacefaring nations. To prevent this, the U.N. could mediate a new global legal framework. However, doing so would necessitate a revision of the U.N. Charter. This would enable the dissolution of the Security Council (SC) and the creation of a U.N. Parliament, thereby fostering a more democratic U.N. and returning the original concept of “we the peoples” to prominence. Granting jurisdictional authority to the U.N. Parliament would also foster a more equitable legislative process, leading to a new and sustainable global OST. The legal mechanism to achieve this already exists within the U.N. Charter itself. Reintroducing Article 109: a pathway to U.N. 2.0 and a new Global Outer Space Treaty Article 109, also referred to as the San Francisco Promise, clearly states that “A General Conference of the Members of the UN for the purpose of reviewing the present Charter may be held at a date and place to be fixed by a two-thirds vote of the members of the General Assembly (GA) and by a vote of any nine members of the SC… If such a conference has not been held before the tenth annual session of the GA following the coming into force of the present Charter, the proposal to call such a conference shall be placed on the agenda of that session of the GA, and the conference shall be held if so decided by a majority vote of the members of the GA and by a vote of any seven members of the SC.” It was not until 1967 that the General Assembly passed a resolution postponing the review conference indefinitely, without officially cancelling the Review process altogether. This effectively left the member states in a state of noncompliance, as they had failed to uphold their charter-mandated obligation to periodically review and potentially revise the U.N.’s founding document. Given the current dynamism and rapid evolution of outer space activities, as well as the ongoing legal discrepancies and ambiguities surrounding this domain, India — another prominent spacefaring nation with its own lunar ambitions — could take the lead in proposing an international conference to address these critical issues. India’s representatives at the U.N. have already expressed dissatisfaction with the U.N. Charter, underscoring the need for a comprehensive review and potential updates to the international regulatory framework. In 2023, they stated that the charter has failed in handling multiple crises the world is facing, calling it “anachronistic.” According to the constitutional history of the U.N., India, most Latin American countries and several other states in 1945 were strongly opposed to the SC’s preeminent role and supremacy in international law. These nations were actively seeking substantial changes to the U.N. Charter as soon as World War II had concluded. The spirit and text of Article 109 provides a critical opportunity for the U.N. to reinvent and restructure itself in order to better address the rapidly evolving global challenges of the post-war era, such as the pressing issues of nuclear disarmament and the emerging need for comprehensive global governance frameworks to manage the exploration and utilization of outer space.

      "WASHINGTON — NASA and the Japanese space agency JAXA plan to operate an instrument on an X-ray astronomy satellite as-is for at least the next year and a half despite an issue affecting one of its instruments. JAXA launched the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) in September 2023 and the spacecraft, whose instruments were developed in collaboration with NASA, has started its prime science mission. XRISM carries two instruments to conduct X-ray astronomy. In January, project scientists said that XRISM was working well except for an aperture door, also called a gate valve, for the Dewar on its imaging instrument, Resolve, which failed to open. The instrument can still operate with the door closed, although the door, made of beryllium, does attenuate some X-rays at lower energies. At the time, efforts were underway to try and open the gate valve. However, speaking at a May 7 meeting of the National Academies’ Board on Physics and Astronomy, Mark Clampin, director of NASA’s astrophysics division, said those efforts were on hold for the next year and a half. “We decided that the best course of action right now is to move forward with the science program for the next 18 months,” he said, saying that the instrument is still doing “really great science” despite the valve being stuck in place. “We believe that the best approach is to spend the next 18 months collecting science data with this mission before another attempt is made to try to dislodge the gate valve.” The valve was supposed to be moved out of the way through two non-explosive actuators. “We believe, based on the information that we have been given by the Japanese, that there is probably a snag on a harness attached to one of the non-explosive actuators, which is preventing the valve from moving out of the way.” One reason for the delay, he said, is the difficulty dealing with harness at cryogenic temperatures. The proposed fixes for the harness, he said, involve managing temperatures of part of the instrument as well as putting “some kind of perturbation” into it to shake the harness loose. “We believe right now the lowest-risk approach is to continue getting science, and we’ll come back to the gate valve in 18 months.” NSF astronomy budget challenges In his presentation, Clampin briefly touched on budget issues facing his decision, including proposals to review changes to operations of the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope to reduce their costs. Those efforts are ongoing, he said, with no major updates on their progress. NASA is not the only agency facing difficulty funding major astronomy programs. Later in the board meeting, R. Chris Smith, interim director of the astronomical sciences division at the National Science Foundation, said his agency had recently decided to halt work on a major ground-based astrophysical project. That project, called CMB-S4, had planned to establish an observatory at the South Pole to study the cosmic microwave background, a signature of the Big Bang at microwave wavelengths, to better understand the early history of the universe as well as dark matter and dark energy. It was one of the top priorities for groundbased facilities in the Astro2020 decadal survey as well as a separate review of priorities in particle physics. Smith announced at the board meeting that NSF had decided not to move CMB-S4 into its next phase of development, called Major Facility Design Stage, at the current time. He cited the needs for NSF to invest in overall infrastructure at the South Pole. “The agency must prioritize the recapitalization of the critical infrastructure at the South Pole,” he said. That work, he said, would support a wide range of science done at the South Pole, not just astrophysics, stating later that CMB-S4 could move forward at some later, undefined date. One factor in that decision is the agency’s budget. NSF requested $11.3 billion in fiscal year 2024 but received less than $9.1 billion. Smith said NSF is still working on an operating plan for 2024, with no details yet how it would affect work at its various divisions, including astronomical sciences. That is also affecting how the NSF approaches the highest groundbased astronomy priority in Astro2020, support for the U.S. Extremely Large Telescope (US-ELT) program. That would provide funding for two large telescopes under development now, the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) and Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). NSF would partially fund both telescopes and get a share of observing time it would make available to the broader astrophysics community. The NSF announced in March that the National Science Board had recommended NSF proceed with support of just one of the two telescopes, with a cost cap of $1.6 billion. That came at the same time as the report accompanying the final fiscal year 2024 appropriations bill included language that “strongly encourages” the NSF to support both US-ELT telescopes. Smith said at the board meeting that the NSF, at a May 2 meeting, formally kicked off the process to decide with of the two large telescope projects. The director of NSF, Sethuraman Panchanathan, formally directed the agency to begin an external review that will provide him with advice on whether to support either telescope. That review will examine the progress GMT and TMT have made since their preliminary design reviews and how they are mitigating various risks. The review will also examine how going forward with either telescope would affect overall NSF resources. Smith said that review is scheduled to be completed by September, but didn’t indicate when NSF would formally select one of the telescope projects for agency support.",

      "Here is SpacePolicyOnline.com’s list of space policy events for the week of May 12-18, 2024 and any insight we can offer about them. The House and Senate are in session this week. During the Week This could be the week Boeing’s Starliner Crew Flight Test actually lifts off. At the moment the launch is targeted for Friday at 6:16 pm ET, but the fact that the crew — Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams — decided to return to Houston instead of remaining at Kennedy Space Center may hint at a longer delay. The scheduled launch on May 6 was scrubbed because of a malfunctioning valve in the Centaur upper stage of the United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket. Engineers determined it had to be replaced, which cannot be accomplished on the launch pad. The rocket, with the Starliner capsule on top, rolled back to ULA’s Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) for repair. They set May 17 as the “no earlier than” launch date. We’ll see if they’re ready by then. As the saying goes, always better to be on the ground wishing you were in space than the reverse. Teams from @ulalaunch have returned the #Starliner and Atlas V rocket to its integration facility to replace a valve on the rocket’s upper stage. @NASA’s @BoeingSpace Crew Flight Test is targeted to launch no earlier than 6:16pm ET May 17. More: https://t.co/8Wxbz9eq7h pic.twitter.com/jZmhTU1v1w — NASA Commercial Crew (@Commercial_Crew) May 8, 2024 This also could be the week Congress finally passes the FAA Reauthorization bill (H.R. 3935). The vast majority of the bill is unrelated to space, but it does include an extension of the commercial human spaceflight “learning period” until January 1, 2025, prohibiting the FAA from promulgating new regulations until then. That restriction usually is dealt with in commercial space legislation, not the FAA bill, but they need to bridge the gap until a new commercial space bill is enacted. The FAA has to be reauthorized every 5 years and its last authorization expired on September 30. Congress has been passing short-term extensions while awaiting agreement on a new 5-year bill. The Senate finally passed its version on Thursday based on a bipartisan agreement among the leaders of the House and Senate committees that oversee the FAA. They also passed a one-week extension (H.R. 8289) of the temporary authorization since it would have expired on Friday (the House approved it earlier). The 5-year bill includes a provision that’s strongly opposed by the politicians who represent the DC-Maryland-Virginia (DMV) area because it increases the number of flights allowed at Reagan National Airport. The four “no” votes in the Senate were from those Senators. Their House counterparts are also likely to oppose it. Others want to add a lot of unrelated provisions because this is one of the few pieces of major legislation likely to clear Congress this year. However, it is on the House schedule on the suspension calendar, which does not allow amendments and requires a two-thirds vote for passage. House leadership apparently thinks they’ve got enough support for it to pass. Assuming it does pass, that only extends the learning period for a few months. Separate legislation will have to be enacted before January 1 to keep it in place. The House committee-approved commercial space bill (H.R. 6131) would extend it until 2031. A Senate bill has been introduced (S. 4064) that would extend it for 5 years from whenever the bill is enacted, but also includes a sunset provision. New regulations are permitted after that. Stay tuned for more action on those bills. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees continue to hold hearings on FY2025 budget requests. The Senate Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee will hear from the Department of Commerce on Tuesday and the House Financial Services-General Government subcommittee from the FCC on Wednesday (postponed from last week). It’s not clear how much, if any, of the discussion will focus on space. Arizona State University’s Interplanetary Initiative and New America have an event tomorrow and Tuesday that’s rather unique. The Space Intersections Symposium will discuss “How will religious and political ideologies define the future of human expansion into space.” It’s not a typical space conference. The themes are: Ideologies and Space Expansionism, Geopolitics, and Justification of Space Expansionism. Among the speakers are Asif Siddiqi (Fordham Univ.) on “Cosmism, Atheism, and Socialism: Millenarian Cosmologies of the Soviet Space Program,” Lincoln Hines (GaTech) on “Ideology and Chinese Space Expansionism,” Lance Gharavi (ASU) on “Look to the Heavens: Religion and Space Exploration in the U.S. and Russia,” Anthony Milligan (ASU) on “Why are Shingon Buddhists Launching a Temple Satellite,” and Linda Billings (Consultant) on “Does NASA Know What’s Good for the World?” Many more intriguing topics throughout the two days. The in-person event is at ASU’s center in D.C. and it will be livestreamed by ASU and New America. On a completely different note, the Council on Foreign Relations has an interesting event tomorrow evening with the military service chiefs discussing “U.S. defense priorities around the world and the state of the American armed forces.” Chief of Space Operations Gen. B. Chance Saltzman will be there to share the U.S. Space Force’s perspective. He’ll be joined by his counterparts from the other services: U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, U.S. Navy Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Eric Smith, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin, and Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard Adm. Linda Fagan. We often hear jointly from Space Force and Air Force leaders, especially at congressional hearings since both services are part of the Department of the Air Force, but this will paint a broader picture and should illustrate where space fits into it. The CFR website says it starts at 5:30 pm ET, but it’ll air on YouTube and that says 6:00 pm ET. Those and other events we know about as of Sunday morning are shown below. Check back throughout the week for others we learn about later and add to our Calendar or changes to these. Monday, May 13 Military Strategy and Leadership (Council on Foreign Relations), virtual?, watch on YouTube at 6:00 pm ET Monday-Tuesday, May 13-14 Space Intersections Symposium (ASU/New America), ASU Barbara Barrett & O’Connor Washington Center, 1800 I St, NW, Washington, DC, livestreamed Monday-Wednesday, May 13-15 NASA Extraterrestrial Materials Analysis Group (ExMAG), Lunar and Planetary Institute, Houston, TX Tuesday-Wednesday, May 14-15 On the Road To Management and Sustainability of Outer Space Activities (UNOOSA/Portugese Space Agency), Lisbon, Portugal Wednesday, May 15 Wednesday-Thurdsay, May 15-16 COSMIC Convergence Workshop, Logan, UT (COSMIC members only) Thursday, May 16 Friday, May 17",

      "WASHINGTON — An agreement between the United States and Japan on contributions for the Artemis lunar exploration campaign could create additional opportunities for a Japanese lunar lander developer. Tokyo-based ispace cited the April 10 agreement between NASA and the Japanese government regarding roles in Artemis as a potential new market for the company. Under the agreement, the Japanese space agency JAXA will provide a pressurized rover for Artemis mission starting in the early 2030s, with NASA includes two seats on Artemis landing missions for JAXA astronauts. “We believe that the Japan-U.S. agreement on the Artemis program, made in April of this year, created a quite positive business environment for us to work with and contribute to the governments of the various countries,” Takeshi Hakamada, chief executive of ispace, said in a May 10 earnings call about the company’s financial results for the fiscal year ending in March 2024. He argued that the agreement would create demand for the kinds of small robotic lunar landers that ispace is developing. “A number of scientific exploration and technology demonstration missions using small landers will most likely be required,” he said. “Once manned missions begin, supplementary missions using small landers will also be necessary.” He acknowledged later in the call that it was too early to estimate how big this demand for additional landers might be from Japan. He noted that the Japanese government plans to invest one trillion yen ($6.4 billion) over 10 years in the country’s commercial space sector. “We assume a large, significant portion of the funding will be allocated to lunar-related activities in the future,” he said. The company is currently working on three landers in Japan and the United States. Its Mission 2, or M2, lander, a copy of the HAKUTO-R M1 lander that crashed attempting a landing in April 2023, is nearing completion. It is scheduled to launch on a Falcon 9 late this year. The company’s U.S. subsidiary, ispace U.S., is developing its first APEX 1.0 lander under a contract with Draper for a NASA Commercial Lunar Payload Services mission in 2026 that ispace calls M3. In Japan, ispace is starting design of a lander called Series 3 supported by a Japanese government grant that will launch on a mission designated M6 in 2027. That parallel development is capital intensive. The company raised 8.1 billion yen in a secondary stock sale March 28, with most of the funding going towards aspects of the M3 lander, including its launch and work on two relay satellites needed for communications with the lander, which will go to the far side of the moon. The company also borrowed 7 billion yen from Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation April 30. “We expect to record a net loss due to a large R&D cost for the development of the landers, therefore, we concluded that it was crucial for us to maintain an equity buffer to improve our financial health,” said Jumpei Nozaki, chief financial officer of ispace, explaining why the company raised money through the stock sale and loan. The company reported net sales of 2.36 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 2024, with a net loss of 2.37 billion yen. That loss, he said, was reduced from the proceeds of an insurance policy the company had taken for the M1 lander. For the current fiscal year ending in March 2025, ispace is forecasting a much bigger loss, of nearly 12.5 billion yen, with net sales of 4.03 billion yen. The sharp increase in the net loss, Nozaki said, is linked to the projected completion and launch of M2 and ongoing work on M3. “This will be a significant net loss,” he said. “But, let me stress that this amount of net loss is in line with our original plan and projections.” The company also announced in the earnings call it had signed up a new customer for M3, a Romanian company called CDS that will demonstrate precision location measurement technology on the lander. CDS is the third customer for M3 after NASA and Rhea Space Activity, which will test navigation technologies on the relay satellites accompanying the lander.",

      "After a night of stunning auroras across much of the United States and Europe on Friday, a severe geomagnetic storm is likely to continue through at least Sunday, forecasters said. The Space Weather Prediction Center at the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Prediction Center observed that 'Extreme' G5 conditions were ongoing as of Saturday morning due to heightened Solar activity. \"The threat of additional strong flares and CMEs (coronal mass ejections) will remain until the large and magnetically complex sunspot cluster rotates out of view over the next several days,\" the agency posted in an update on the social media site X on Saturday morning. Good and bad effects For many observers on Friday night the heightened Solar activity was welcomed. Large areas of the United States, Europe, and other locations unaccustomed to displays of the aurora borealis saw vivid lights as energetically charged particles from the Solar storm passed through the Earth's atmosphere. Brilliantly pink skies were observed as far south as Texas. Given the forecast for ongoing Solar activity, another night of extended northern lights is possible again on Saturday. There were also some harmful effects. According to NOAA, there have been some irregularities in power grid transmissions, and degraded satellite communications and GPS services. Users of SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet constellation have reported slower download speeds. Early on Saturday morning, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said the company's Starlink satellites were \"under a lot of pressure, but holding up so far.\" Advertisement This is the most intense Solar storm recorded in more than two decades. The last G5 event—the most extreme category of such storms—occurred in October 2003 when there were electricity issues reported in Sweden and South Africa. Should this storm intensify over the next day or two, scientists say the major risks include more widespread power blackouts, disabled satellites, and long-term damage of GPS networks. Cause of these storms Such storms are triggered when the Sun ejects a significant amount of its magnetic field and plasma into the Solar wind. The underlying causes of these coronal mass ejections, deeper in the Sun, are not fully understood. But it is hoped that data collected by NASA's Parker Solar Probe and other observations will help scientists better understand and predict such phenomena. When these coronal mass ejections reach Earth's magnetic field they change it, and can introduce significant currents into electricity lines and transformers, leading to damages or outages. The most intense geomagnetic storm occurred in 1859, during the so-called Carrington Event. This produced auroral lights around the world, and caused fires in multiple telegraph stations—at the time there were 125,000 miles of telegraph lines in the world. According to one research paper on the Carrington Event, \"At its height, the aurora was described as a blood or deep crimson red that was so bright that one 'could read a newspaper by'.\"",

      "Earth is on the receiving end of intense solar activity this weekend — a burst of “space weather.” NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center issues warnings on a five-point scale because satellites and the terrestrial electric grid are vulnerable to outages from the high radiation levels. G5 is the highest and NOAA issued a G5 alert this evening. The radiation can also pose a danger to astronauts on the International Space Station, but NASA is not concerned for now. Separately, NASA confirmed that the rescheduled launch of the Starliner Crew Flight Test is still on track for May 17, but the two crew members are returning to Houston instead of remaining at Kennedy Space Center. NOAA reported at 8:38 pm ET that G5 space weather conditions have been observed for the first time since 2003. The radiation is the result of strong Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) from a cluster of sunspots that is “17 times the diameter of Earth.” The storm is expected to persist at varying intensity levels through the weekend. The Sun’s magnetic fields switch places every 11 years, creating sunspots. The most sunspots occur in the middle of that cycle, the solar maximum. The current cycle began in 2019, so 2024-2025 is the time of highest activity. The most visible evidence on Earth usually are breathtaking auroras that can be seen much further from the poles than usual, but in some cases the electric grid and satellites can experience outages because of the effect on electronics. Increased solar activity also changes the density of the upper atmosphere and increases drag on satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO). Satellites in LEO have to boost their orbits several times a year in any case, but must do so much more often during periods of high solar activity. NOAA says instead of about four times a year, it’s required every 2-3 weeks. The International Space Station also is in LEO. The increased solar activity not only affects its orbit, but seven people live there. Astronauts are routinely monitored for radiation exposure and NASA said in a statement this evening that if necessary they can shelter in areas where the 420 Metric Ton facility has higher amounts of shielding because of more station mass. That’s not necessary for now, however. “NASA completed a thorough analysis of recent space weather activity and determined it posed no risk to the crew aboard the International Space Station and no additional precautionary measures are needed.” — NASA statement Four Americans and three Russians are currently aboard the ISS. Separately, NASA said tonight that the two NASA astronauts who will fly the Starliner Crew Flight Test, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, are returning to Houston instead of remaining at Kennedy Space Center until their rocket is fixed. NASA originally said they would stay in quarantine at KSC. No explanation was provided for the change in plans, but they will remain quarantined. NASA also did not specify when they will return to KSC. Wilmore and Williams were about two hours from launch on May 6 when a scrub was called because United Launch Alliance (ULA) engineers detected a problem with one of the valves in the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V rocket. They concluded the valve must be replaced, which meant rolling the rocket back to ULA’s Vertical Integration Facility. That delayed the launch for a week-and-a-half with May 17 set as the “no earlier than” launch date. NASA restated tonight that the launch is targeted for May 17.",

      "HELSINKI — Serbia has signed an agreement on participating in the China-led International Lunar Research Station. Serbia’s Ministry of Science, Technological Development and Innovation signed a memorandum of understanding with the China National Space Administration (CNSA) on cooperation on the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) earlier this week. The development was listed in a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs document published May 9, listing outcomes following Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Serbia May 7-8. CNSA has yet to issue its own statement on the matter. The pair also signed an MoU on cooperation in the field of innovation in the exploration and peaceful use of outer space, in addition to that on the ILRS. The China-led ILRS envisions constructing a permanent lunar base in the 2030s. This will be constructed using a super heavy-lift launcher. China also aims to send astronauts to the moon before 2030. It will launch precursor missions in the 2020s. These include Chang’e-7 around 2026 and the later Chang’e-8 in-situ resource utilization technology test mission. Both multi-spacecraft missions will target the lunar south pole. The Chang’e-6 sample return mission—currently in lunar orbit ahead of an expected early June landing attempt—is nominally part of the program. Chinese officials state that ILRS has a number of scientific and engineering goals. These include lunar and Earth science, astronomy, conducting experiments and resource utilization. Others are stated to involve driving technological development and laying the foundation for further space lunar exploration. Russia this week stated it was developing a nuclear power unit for the joint lunar station, Reuters reported, citing the RIA news agency. It is not clear how Serbia will be involved in and contribute to the ILRS at this stage. China previously stated its intent to create the ILRS Cooperation Organization (ILRSCO) to oversee and manage the project. Its establishment and subsequent meetings will likely to begin to map out Serbia’s and other parties’ involvement in the project. The development is, however, notable for a number of reasons. “I think it speaks to the interest in getting access to the moon and not just that, but an interest in seeking out a partner that has been very effective in using space as a form of soft power outreach: China,” Victoria Samson, chief director of Space Security and Stability at the Secure World Foundation, told SpaceNews via email. “And while the agreement was done with China, I think you can’t overlook the historical closeness Serbia has had with Russia and the ties between the increasingly autocratic president of Serbia and Putin. So signing the ILRS allows Serbia to reconfirm its connection to Russia while getting a much more tangible benefit in terms of its relationship with China.” “The more countries that sign onto either the Artemis Accords or the ILRS, the more it is evident that it is crucial that we figure out now—while exploration there is at the very beginning stages—how best to deconflict activities on the moon and make clear what all stakeholders believe to be responsible behavior in cislunar space so that we can ensure sustainable access to the moon and its environs for the long-term,” Samson added. Serbia becomes the 11th country to join the ILRS, following Nicaragua and Thailand in April. China and Russia formally announced the joint ILRS project in St. Petersburg, Russia, in June 2021. Venezuela, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Belarus, South Africa and Egypt signed up during 2023. LRS Signatory Type China Country Russia Country Belarus Country Pakistan Country Azerbaijan Country Venezuela Country South Africa Country Egypt Country Nicaragua Country Serbia Country Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization (APSCO) Inter-governmental Organization nanoSPACE AG (Switzerland) Firm International Lunar Observatory Association (ILOA, Hawaii) Organization National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand (NARIT) Institute University of Sharjah (UAE) University Adriatic Aerospace Association (A3) (Croatia) Organization Asociación de Astronomía de Colombia (ASASAC) Organization Arabaev Kyrgyz State University (Kyrgyzstan) University PT Universal Satelit Indonesia (UniSat) Firm Arab Union for Astronomy and Space Sciences Organization List of known ILRS entities signing agreements on the ILRS (Andrew Jones/SpaceNews) The constellation of countries signing to the ILRS up appears illustrative of a wider Chinese focus on the Global South. China has also attracted a number of organizations, universities and companies to join ILRS. This includes the Adriatic Aerospace Association (A3) in Croatia. The ILRS MoU is not China and Serbia’s first bilateral space agreement. The countries signed a memorandum on space technology in 2020. That agreement aimed to put a Serbian flag on a co-designed spacecraft. It also aimed to improve cooperation in the development and use of space technology for a range of applications. Serbia, situated on Europe’s Balkan Peninsula, has a modest space sector. Serbian universities and research institutions are involved in space sciences and related fields and engaged in international projects. The University of Belgrade has, for example, engaged research in astrophysics, satellite engineering and remote sensing. Serbia is neither a European Space Agency (ESA) member, nor an ESA associate member, nor does it have a cooperation agreement with the agency. Hungary, to which Xi Xinping made a state visit following Serbia, is a full ESA member. It did not appear to sign an agreement on the ILRS during that visit.",
